# Gradio Demonstration With Huggingface Space
![img](./img/huggingface.png)

If I have to describe Hugging Face one sentences that will be "it's like github but machine learning models". Ofcourse huggingface more than that. But it's enough for this guideline. Gradio is an open-source Python library that allows you to create web applications with such ease.


In this guideline, I will explain how to upload your machine learning model to Hugging Face and how to create Gradio demos.

The instructions consist of two steps. First making model ready to huggingface and creating gradio demo.


## Huggingface Model

### Making read model

For CNN model I will use [Machine Learning Zoomcamp's](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp) Fashion classification last [model](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/blob/master/08-deep-learning/notebook.ipynb)
